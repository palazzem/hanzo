This [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbook configures a new ArchLinux
installation with some development tools. The goal of the playbook is *inspiring
developers* to prepare programmatically their development environment. This
repository targets my requirements and it's very unlikely it can be used in a
general purpose sense.

## Quickstart

If you like living on the bleeding edge and *curlbombs* don't scare you, the
automatic installer is the easiest way to configure your system:

```shell
    $ sh <(curl -L http://j.mp/hattori-hanzo)
```

A clean ArchLinux installation is recommended but not required. Anyway, bear
in mind it **WILL OVERWRITE ENTIRELY** your system.

If you use this approach, nothing else is required and you can enjoy your
new system!

## Manual Installation

In case you don't want to use the `curl` command above, you can clone or
download this repository, using either `git` or the [release page](https://github.com/palazzem/hanzo/releases).
After the checkout, run the following commands:

```shell
    $ cd hanzo/
    $ HANZO_FOLDER=$(pwd) bash bin/bootstrap.sh
```

## Unattended Installer

If you don't want to use the interactive shell to configure Hanzo, you can
set the following environment variables:

* `HANZO_FOLDER`: if specified, that folder is used as Hanzo root. If not specified, the bootstrap script fetches Hanzo from GitHub.
* `HANZO_FULLNAME`: your full name used in the `.gitconfig`.
* `HANZO_EMAIL`: your email address used in the `.gitconfig`.
* `HANZO_USERNAME`: username used to create the main user.
* `TAGS`: sets Ansible tags. Available options are `[chromeos]`. If not tags are set, a standard Archlinux toolbox is configured.
* `EXTRA_ARGS`: sets Ansible extra arguments. Use this variable if you want to set options such as `--verbose` or `--check`.

## Testing

If you want to apply the playbook changes without touching your current
configuration, or you want to test any change of the current configuration,
a `Dockerfile` is available to build an ArchLinux container. To start the
provisioning, just:

```shell
    $ docker build -t hanzo:test . \
        --build-arg HANZO_FULLNAME=test \
        --build-arg HANZO_USERNAME=test \
        --build-arg HANZO_EMAIL=test@example.com \
        && docker rmi hanzo:test
```

## Contribute

The playbook provisions a machine with my current configuration. Because
it's unlikely that you use exactly my current environment, you may use
this repository as a base to create your own configuration. Indeed, I'll
be glad to accept any PR that:

* Fixes the current playbook execution
* Improves the playbook styles or Ansible best practices
* Enhances or makes me aware of different methods to distribute the playbook

I will not accept any PR that adds new development tools, but I will be
grateful if you can discuss about it in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/palazzem/hanzo/issues).
